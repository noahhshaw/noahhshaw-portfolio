# Website Build Instructions: noahhshaw.com
**Final Specification for Claude Code**

**Tone:** *"Product leader who has demonstrated the ability to build valuable products in complex domains"*

**What to AVOID:**
- Poor use of whitespace / cluttered layouts
- Walls of descriptive text
- Skill bars, percentages, or metrics displays
- Template-y or generic tech aesthetics
- Purple/blue color schemes
- "Coming soon" placeholders
- Anything that feels eager or salesy

**What to EMBRACE:**
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Scannable, minimal content
- Professional restraint
